Todo API Design:

Models:
The Todo API has a single model named Todo with the following schema:
const todoSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String },
  completed: { type: Boolean, default: false },
  created_at: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});

javascript
Copy code
const todoSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String },
  completed: { type: Boolean, default: false },
  created_at: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
});

Endpoints:
GET /todos: Retrieve all todo items.
POST /todos: Create a new todo item.
GET /todos/:id: Retrieve a specific todo item by its ID.
PUT /todos/:id: Update a specific todo item by its ID.
DELETE /todos/:id: Delete a specific todo item by its ID.

Controllers:
getAllTodos: Retrieve all todos.
createTodo: Create a new todo.
getTodoById: Retrieve a specific todo by ID.
updateTodoById: Update a specific todo by ID.
deleteTodoById: Delete a specific todo by ID.

Middleware:
auth: Middleware to authenticate requests using a Bearer token.
How to Run and Test Todo API:
Prerequisites:
Node.js installed.
MongoDB installed and running.
Steps:
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies: npm install.
Set up a .env file with your MongoDB URI and other necessary configurations.
Run the server: npm start.

Testing:
Unit tests: Run npm test.
Load testing: Follow load testing instructions below.

Load Testing:
Load Testing Results:
Load testing was performed using Artillery.
Configuration file: artillery-config.yml (Example provided).
Results indicated the API's ability to handle a specified duration and arrival rate.

Instructions for Load Testing:
Install Artillery globally: npm install -g artillery.
Configure the artillery-config.yml file based on your load testing requirements.
Run the load test: artillery run artillery-config.yml.

Discussion:
Load testing helps evaluate system behavior under expected and peak loads.
Analyze response times, error rates, and system resource utilization.
Adjust configurations based on results to optimize performance.
Note: Customize configurations and instructions based on your specific API requirements and environment.
